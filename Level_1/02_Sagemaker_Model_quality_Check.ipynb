Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that encompasses the entire ML workflow. You can label and prepare your data, choose an algorithm, train a model, and then tune and optimize it for deployment. You can deploy your models to production with Amazon SageMaker to make predictions and lower costs than it was previously possible.\n","\n","Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor allows you to maintain high quality ML models by automatically detecting and helping you remediate inaccuracies in model predictions. Model Monitor helps\n","you detect changes in properties of independent variables to help maintain data quality, and\n","monitors model performance characteristics such as accuracy and precision in real-time to\n","help maintain model quality.\n","\n","In this notebook, you learn how to use Amazon SageMaker model quality monitoring capability to monitor model performance characteristics of your in-production ML models.
